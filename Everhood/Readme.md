# Everhood Autosplitter

Works for all Windows Everhood versions downloaded from Steam.

## Features
- Auto Start
- Auto Split
- Load Removal

## Contributers
- [DeamonHunter](https://github.com/DeamonHunter) - Original creator
- [Ero](https://github.com/just-ero) - Creator of the Mono tools, and integrated them into the Autosplitter.

## Notes
- Timing starts on the scene transition after selecting difficulty. The timer starts with 10 seconds already on the clock to compensate for that.
- This will split even if you fail to defeat a boss and that failure kicks you out to the overworld.
