# Everhood Autosplitter

## Features
- Auto Start
- Auto Split
- Load Removal

## Notes
- Timing starts on the scene transition after selecting difficulty. The timer starts with 10 seconds already on the clock to compensate for that.
- This will split even if you fail to defeat a boss and that failure kicks you out to the overworld.
